Getting started
===============
We've got a great screencast about the Seedlings project,
which is a great way to get an overall feel for Sitebox:

	http://playerio.com/showcase/seedlings-sitebox-example/
	
	
The Sitebox Files folder contains all the Sitebox Templates,
stylesheets, images and other files that are
automatically uploaded into GameFS when you create a
Facebook App on Sitebox. 

To open the Seedlings game locally do the following:

	a) Install the debussy.ttf font
	
	b) Open the seedlings.fla file from the Flash folder
	
	c) Put your gameid into the Flash/Game.as file where it says "[Enter your game id here]"
		If you don't have a gameid, simply login into the player.io admin dashboard
		and click "create game".

	d) Put your Facebook Application Id into the Flash/Game.as file where it says "[Enter your facebook application id here]"
		If you don't have a Facebook Application Id, you'll have to create an application on Facebook first.
		
	e) Press ctrl-enter inside flash to launch the client .swf file.
