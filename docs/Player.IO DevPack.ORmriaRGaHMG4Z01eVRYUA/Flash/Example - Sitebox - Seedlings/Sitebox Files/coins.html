	<h2>Get more Coins for Seedlings</h2>
	<p>This is a sample page that shows offers to get more coins for the Seedlings game.</p>
	<p>Note: You can complete these offers, but there is nothing you can *do* with coins in the game. This is just a page to showcase the easy integration that <a href="http://playerio.com/features/payvault">PayVault</a> offers.</p>
